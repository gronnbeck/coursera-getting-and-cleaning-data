# Project: Getting and cleaning data 

Welcome! I understand that you have come to this link for one purpose.
To verify that the data I have generated is corrected.
To do so you have to perform the following steps.

** Step 1 ** 
Clone the repository to your machine. On a Unix based system (and some windows system) you can use the following command to do so
```sh
git clone git@github.com:gronnbeck/coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data.git
```

** Step 2 **
Open the project in RStudio, or use a terminal, to run the ``run_analysis.r`` file. 

** Step 3 ** 
The result will be stored in the ``project``-folder as ``tidytidy.txt``
